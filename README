Data::Record::Serialize

   Data::Record::Serialize encodes data records and sends them
   somewhere. It is primarily useful for output of sets of uniformly
   structured data records.  It provides a uniform, thin, interface to
   various serializers and output sinks.  Its raison d'etre is its
   ability to manipulate the records prior to encoding and output.
